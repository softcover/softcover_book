# Getting started
\label{cha:getting_started}

This is [*The Softcover Book*](https://manual.softcover.io/book)---the manual for *Softcover*, a publishing platform for technical authors. Softcover consists of two main parts: a state-of-the-art [open-source ebook typesetting system](https://github.com/softcover/softcover) (Section~\ref{sec:softcover_system}), and an [online platform](https://www.softcover.io/) for publishing, marketing, and selling ebooks and other digital goods (Section~\ref{sec:softcover_website}). Based on the technology used to make the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](https://www.railstutorial.org/) and [*The Tau Manifesto*](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), Softcover makes publishing *frictionless* by allowing authors to build and deploy ebooks and other digital goods with a single command.

The Softcover production toolchain and publishing platform are especially designed to help authors make the transition from "writing a book" to "building a business," using the following [three-step plan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts):

1. Make ebooks, screencasts, etc.
2. Sell HTML and ebooks and multiple product bundles
3. Profit!!!

\noindent Of course, it's not necessary to follow the Three Step Plan\texttrademark\ exactly, and Softcover can be used for many different purposes (Box~\ref{aside:softcover_uses}).

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:softcover_uses}
\heading{How to use Softcover}

\noindent Softcover is a flexible tool, so it has many potential uses. The first use represents Softcover's principal design goal, but the others are valid possibilities as well:


* **Make an HTML book, bundle ebooks with other digital goods, and sell them from the [Softcover.io](https://www.softcover.io/) online storefront**
* Charge for all products (including the HTML book) at [Softcover.io](https://www.softcover.io/)
* Produce ebooks with the Softcover typesetting system and give them away
* Produce ebooks with Softcover and sell them using the [Softcover.io](https://www.softcover.io/) online storefront
* Produce ebooks with Softcover and sell them from your own website
* Use Softcover to make ebooks out of technical documentation and host them on an internal website

\end{aside}

Softcover is inspired by the philosophy of *full author ownership*:

* **Own your content**: Authors retain copyright on all materials.
* **Own your production toolchain**: The Softcover typesetting system is open-source, so you aren't locked into a proprietary toolchain.
* **Own your traffic**: Softcover supports custom domains.
* **Own your customer list**: Authors get all relevant contact information and never have to use an intermediary to communicate with their customers.

\noindent In short, Softcover is a publishing platform I would be happy to use even if I weren't one of the founders of the company.

In the rest of this chapter, we'll cover the steps needed to install and use the Softcover typesetting system, which includes a command-line interface for building and publishing ebooks. Subsequent chapters cover Markdown, the default input format for Softcover (Chapter~\ref{cha:introduction_to_markdown} and Chapter~\ref{cha:softcover_flavored_markdown}), and \PolyTeX, a more complicated but more powerful input format based on the \LaTeX\ typesetting language (Chapter~\ref{cha:polytex_tutorial}).

## The Softcover typesetting system
\label{sec:softcover_system}

In this section, we'll cover the basics of the Softcover open-source ebook typesetting system for technical authors. Its [*raison d'\^{e}tre*](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/raison%20d'etre) is producing profes\-sional-grade multi-format ebooks from a common set of source files. In particular, Softcover accepts input in *Markdown*, a lightweight markup language, or *\PolyTeX*, a subset of the powerful \LaTeX\ typesetting language, and outputs ebooks as HTML, EPUB, MOBI, and PDF\@. The Softcover system also comes with a local server that automatically rebuilds a book's HTML output when the source files change, so that your favorite text editor and web browser combine to form a real-time development environment for writing ebooks. Finally, authors can use Softcover to upload ebooks and other media files to the [Softcover website](https://www.softcover.io/) with a single command (Section~\ref{sec:softcover_website}), thereby dramatically lowering the barrier to publishing, updating, and selling digital information products.

Originally developed under the name *\PolyTeXnic*[^poly_pronunciation] to write the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial* book](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) and [*The Tau Manifesto*](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto), Softcover  has been rewritten and expanded as part of developing the [Softcover publishing platform](https://www.softcover.io/). True to its origins, Softcover supports a wide range of features useful for writing technical books, including mathematical typesetting (Eq.~\eqref{eq:maxwell})[^maxwell] and syntax-highlighted source code listings (Listing~\ref{code:eval}). It is also well-suited to writing non-technical books, with support for chapters, sections, cross-references, footnotes, lists, figures, tables, etc.---the only requirement is that the *author* be technical. (If you know how to use the Unix [command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line) and have a favorite [text editor](https://www.learnenough.com/text-editor), you are technical enough to use Softcover.)



\begin{equation}
\label{eq:maxwell}

\end{aligned}
\right\}

        (else
         (error
          "Unknown procedure type -- APPLY" procedure))))
```
\end{codelisting}

Naturally, *The Softcover Book* itself is written using Softcover. Indeed, you can consider this manual the *de facto* [spec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)) for the system: essentially everything that Softcover can do, this document does. Because the [source code of *The Softcover Book*](http://github.com/softcover/softcover_book) is available online, you can learn how to typeset anything you see in this manual simply by referring to the corresponding place in the source.

### Installing Softcover
\label{sec:installing_softcover}

The Softcover system is open-source software, distributed as a Ruby gem under the permissive [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The \softcover\ gem currently works with macOS and Linux, and we're looking for people to help us adapt it to other OSes. Join the [Softcover Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/softcover-publishing) to be part of that effort.

To get started with Softcover, first [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) (1.9.3 or higher) and [install RubyGems](https://www.railstutorial.org/book#sec-install_rubygems) if you don't have them already. Once you've done so, getting Softcover is usually a simple `gem install`:

```console
$ gem install softcover
```

\noindent If you run into any permissions issues, either use `sudo`[^sudo_install] or (preferred) use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#groom-your-apps-ruby-environment-with-rbenv) to manage your Ruby environment and gems.

There have been some reports of installation issues on macOS (Mavericks and later), so if you run into trouble with the previous step, try this command instead:

```text
$ gem install softcover -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

\noindent or possibly this:

```text
% gem install softcover -- \
                        --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"

```

\noindent or this:

```text
% gem install softcover -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
                        --with-cflags="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration"

```

\noindent This installs the `softcover` command-line interface (CLI) for creating new books, building ebooks, and publishing ebooks and other digital assets to the [Softcover website](https://www.softcover.io/). On some systems, you may have to install extra libraries; for example, on Ubuntu I needed to install `ruby1.9.1-dev` to get the \texttt{nokogiri} gem to install.

To build the full set of output formats, Softcover requires some external dependencies. The `softcover` command will prompt you to install each dependency at the appropriate time, but many users will find it more convenient to install all the dependencies at once. To check which dependencies need to be installed on your system, run `softcover check`:

```console
$ softcover check
Checking Softcover dependencies...
Checking for LaTeX...         Found
Checking for ImageMagick...   Found
Checking for Node.js...       Found
Checking for PhantomJS...     Found
Checking for Inkscape...      Found
Checking for Calibre...       Found
Checking for Java...          Found
Checking for EpubCheck...     Found
All dependencies satisfied.
```

\noindent In the unlikely case that you get the result above, congratulations---you have nothing to install. More likely, though, `softcover check` will indicate several missing dependencies. The output in this case includes URLs for all relevant software, but for convenience we also include them here:

- [LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html)

    The \LaTeX\ download is *big*, so start downloading it now. Also, I strongly recommend installing a precompiled version of \LaTeX\ and *not* building it from source. Make sure to use the version of \LaTeX\ appropriate for your system from the link above; in particular, macOS users should use the [MacTeX package](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) rather than the version installed by Homebrew. Finally, several macOS users have reported having to restart their terminal program after installing Mac\TeX\ in order to enable the \LaTeX\ command-line programs (specifically, `xelatex`).
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (needed only for math output in EPUB and MOBI)

    Development on the PhantomJS project has been suspended but the binaries should still work on most systems. If you have trouble installing PhantomJS on Linux, see [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73004195/phantomjs-wont-install-autoconfiguration-error/73063745) to see if it helps. Finally, if you don't plan to use \LaTeX\ for mathematical typesetting in EPUB and MOBI output, you don’t need PhantomJS at all.

- [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/)
- [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) with the command-line tools (built-in on Linux; on macOS, see below)
- [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml) (chances are you already have this one)
- [EpubCheck 4.0.1](https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases/download/v4.0.1/epubcheck-4.0.1.zip) (unzip and place in a diretory on your path, i.e., \linebreak `$HOME/bin`[^epub_path])

On macOS, the Calibre command-line tools come included with calibre, but in order to make them available you have to put them on your \texttt{PATH}. Using a text editor, put the contents of Listing~\ref{code:calibre_bash_profile} at the end of your `.bash\_profile` file, and then run the `source` command in Listing~\ref{code:source_bash_profile} to update your shell.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:calibre_bash_profile}
\codecaption{Putting the Calibre executables on the \texttt{PATH}. \\ \filepath{\textasciitilde/.bash\_profile}}
```bash

```
\end{codelisting}

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:source_bash_profile}
\codecaption{Sourcing the bash profile.}
```console
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
\end{codelisting}


To see the commands supported by `softcover`, run `softcover help` at the command line, as shown in Listing~\ref{code:softcover_help}.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:softcover_help}
\codecaption{Viewing available Softcover commands with \texttt{softcover help}.}
```console
$ softcover help
Commands:

  softcover version                    # Return the version number (-v for short)
```
\end{codelisting}

\noindent For convenience, Softcover also installs a shorter alias, `sc`, so you can (for example) get the current version number by typing any of the following:

```console
$ softcover version
$ softcover -v
$ sc version
$ sc -v
```

### Creating a Softcover book
\label{sec:softcover_new}

We see from Listing~\ref{code:softcover_help} that the way to generate a new Softcover book is with `softcover new <name>`.[^copy_directories] Let's try it out and see what happens; the results are shown in Listing~\ref{code:new_example_book}.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:new_example_book}
\codecaption{Generating an example book.}

Done. Please update config/book.yml
```
\end{codelisting}

\noindent *Note*: If your document is more naturally thought of as a single article rather than as a book, you should use the *article* format instead, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:articles}. The tutorials at [Learn Enough to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) use this format.

The default book format generated by `softcover new` is *Markdown*---or, rather, a superset of Markdown that includes extensions to make it more suitable for writing longer documents. As discussed in Chapter~\ref{cha:softcover_flavored_markdown}, this includes features such as select [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) extensions (numbered footnotes, tables, etc.),  GitHub-style code fencing, and embedded \LaTeX\@. Authors who want more fine-grained control over their documents (or who already know \LaTeX) can use `softcover new -p <name>` to generate a \PolyTeX\ template instead; see Chapter~\ref{cha:polytex_tutorial} for details.

We see from Listing~\ref{code:new_example_book} that `softcover new` generates a bunch of files, but the heart of it is the `chapters/` directory, which contains the Markdown source for the template book:

```console
$ cd example_book
$ ls chapters/
a_chapter.md           preface.md
another_chapter.md     yet_another_chapter.md
```

\noindent The names of the template form a progression ("A chapter", "Another chapter", "Yet *another* chapter"), but their order is not set by this progression. Rather, it is specified by their order in the file `Book.txt` (Listing~\ref{code:book_txt}).

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:book_txt}
\codecaption{The default contents of \texttt{Book.txt}.}
<<(example_book/Book.txt, lang: text, options: "hl_lines": [7, 8, 9])
\end{codelisting}

\noindent Authors are encouraged to use the template files as a model but to change their names so that they are better tailored to each book's content. For the purposes of this overview, though, we'll stick with the defaults.

Softcover books also come with a `book.yml` configuration file containing some book metadata (Listing~\ref{code:book_yml}). The [slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) represents the last part the book's URL at Softcover.io and should rarely need editing. You should generally change the title, author, subtitle (if any), and description before publishing the book to Softcover; as an example, Listing~\ref{code:custom_book_yml} shows the `book.yml` file for *The Softcover Book*. See Section~\ref{sec:detailed_refinements} and Chapter~\ref{cha:marketing_selling} to learn how to put the finishing touches on before publication.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:book_yml}
\codecaption{The default contents of \texttt{book.yml}. \\ \filepath{config/book.yml}}
<<(example_book/config/book.yml, lang: yaml)
\end{codelisting}

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:custom_book_yml}
\codecaption{The \texttt{book.yml} file for the present book.}
<<(config/book.yml, lang: yaml)
\end{codelisting}

### HTML and the Softcover server
\label{sec:html_softcover_server}

To get started writing the example book, we'll first build an HTML version:

```console
$ softcover build:html
```

\noindent The result is a separate HTML file for each chapter in the `html/` directory, as well as a *frontmatter* file that contains everything that at the front of the book before the main content (such as the book title, author name, table of contents, preface, foreword, etc.).

Let's take a look at the HTML for the frontmatter. On most systems, this can be accomplished by using a filesystem viewer to navigate to the `html/` directory and double-clicking on `frontmatter.html`. On macOS, we can accomplish the same thing at the command line using the `open` command, which opens the given file using the default application for that file type (which on my system is Chrome):

```console
$ open html/frontmatter.html
```

\noindent (Linux users can get the same result using `xdg-open` instead.) Assuming you customized the default `book.yml` in Listing~\ref{code:book_yml}, you should get a result something like the one shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example_frontmatter}.

![Viewing the HTML file for the example book frontmatter.\label{fig:example_frontmatter}](images/figures/example_frontmatter.png)

Although inspecting raw HTML files is sometimes useful for debugging purposes, the best way to develop Softcover books is to use the local Softcover server, which
detects when the source files have changed and automatically refreshes the browser.[^multiple_browsers] (If you change a config or style file and want to rebuild the page, simply re-save one of the source files to prompt the server to refresh the browser.)

To see how this works, let's open up a new terminal tab (Figure~\ref{fig:softcover_server}), navigate to the book directory, and fire up `softcover server`:[^sc_s]

```console
$ softcover server
Building...Done. (0.6s)
Running Softcover server on http://localhost:4000
== Sinatra/1.4.4 has taken the stage on 4000 for development with backup from
Thin
Thin web server (v1.6.1 codename Death Proof)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 0.0.0.0:4000, CTRL+C to stop
```

\noindent (You may have to install a [JavaScript runtime](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) if you don't have one installed already; I recommend [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Also, there have been some reports of the server hanging on macOS, which is likely due to a recent change in the way macOS handles SSL\@. Reinstalling Ruby should fix the issue.) Opening a browser and navigating to \linebreak <http://localhost:4000> then gives us a view of the HTML version of the first chapter of the book (Figure~\ref{fig:localhost_4000})

![Running the Softcover server in a separate tab.\label{fig:softcover_server}](images/figures/softcover_server.png)

![Viewing the book on \href{http://localhost:4000}{http://localhost:4000}.\label{fig:localhost_4000}](images/figures/localhost_4000.png)

Writing books works just fine with a text editor and browser placed side-by-side (Figure~\ref{fig:editor_browser}), but my favorite trick is to connect an iPad to the Softcover server's address on the local network, effectively using the iPad as an external monitor. Then, when I save a source file, the iPad's browser magically refreshes with the updated content. This setup is especially nice for people (like me) who often work remotely and prefer for their production setup to be fully portable.[^ipad_address]

For now, I suggest playing around with the server a little to get the hang of it, and then move on to building the various ebook formats (Section~\ref{sec:building_ebooks}).

*Note*: `softcover server` also supports PDF output. See Section~\ref{sec:build_pdf} for details.

<!-- We'll have more to say about writing a book using the Softcover server in Chapter~\ref{cha:introduction_to_markdown} and Chapter~\ref{cha:polytex_tutorial}. ***is this true?
 -->
![Writing with the editor and browser side-by-side.\label{fig:editor_browser}](images/figures/editor_browser.png)

### Building ebooks
\label{sec:building_ebooks}

As noted in Section~\ref{sec:softcover_system}, the Softcover system outputs HTML, EPUB, MO\-BI, and PDF\@. We saw in Section~\ref{sec:html_softcover_server} that HTML generation comes bundled with the \softcover\ gem; since EPUB is basically zipped HTML, EPUB generation comes for free as well. On the other hand, generating MOBI and PDF books requires installing some external dependencies, as does generating EPUB books if they contain mathematics. The `softcover` command will automatically prompt you to install the relevant software when the time comes; for example, if you try to build a PDF on a system without \LaTeX, you'll get this prompt with a link to the \LaTeX\ installation page:

```console
$ softcover build:pdf
Building PDF...
Document not built due to missing dependency
Install LaTeX (http://latex-project.org/ftp.html)
```

\noindent I recommend installing all the dependencies at once, as described in \linebreak Section~\ref{sec:installing_softcover}.


#### EPUB
\label{sec:build_epub}

EPUB books are essentially HTML combined with CSS and various configuration files, all zipped together in one package. (The easiest way to see this is to change an EPUB file's extension from `.epub` to `.zip` and double-click it to unzip it.) Getting all the details just right is a real pain, though, so Softcover takes care of it for you.

There are no dependencies for building EPUB books unless the source contains mathematics, so if you want you can remove the math from the generated book and build the EPUB immediately. Otherwise, you'll need to install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) and [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/). Building the EPUB is easy once any necessary dependencies are installed:

```console
$ softcover build:epub
```

\noindent By default, the output of `build:epub` is verbose, but you can pass command-line options to make it quiet (`-q`) or silent (`-s`).

The generated EPUB book is located in the `ebooks` directory:

```console
$ ls ebooks/
example_book.epub
```

\noindent If you don't already have an EPUB viewer installed on your computer, I suggest [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html). On macOS, if Adobe Digital Editions is associated with `.epub` files, you can open the example book EPUB like this:

```console
$ open ebooks/example_book.epub
```

\noindent The result appears in Figure~\ref{fig:example_epub}. (*Note*: As of macOS Mavericks, you can also use iBooks to open EPUB files.)

![The example book EPUB.\label{fig:example_epub}](images/figures/example_epub.png)


#### MOBI
\label{sec:build_mobi}

Once you've built an EPUB book, making a MOBI (the native format for Amazon.com's Kindle) is easy. The default method is to use *Calibre*, an open-source ebook manager. To get started, [install Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) and then follow the instructions from Section~\ref{sec:installing_softcover} to enable the Calibre command line tools. Once you've done that, you can build a MOBI file as follows:

```console
$ softcover build:mobi
```

\noindent As with EPUB, you can use command-line options to make the MOBI builder quiet (`-q`) or silent (`-s`).

To view the MOBI file on your computer, I recommend installing [Kindle Reader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000493771). The result appears in Figure~\ref{fig:example_mobi}.

#### PDF
\label{sec:build_pdf}

Although the EPUB and MOBI ebooks formats are increasingly popular, my preferred ebook format (especially for technical books) is PDF\@. Building PDF books requires [installing LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html) (specifically, the `xelatex` executable, which is a Unicode-friendly PDF builder). \LaTeX\ is a large download, but it's easy to install, and in fact you may already have it:

```console
$ which xelatex
```

\noindent If that command returns the path to `xelatex`, you can skip the installation step. In any case, building a PDF is easy once \LaTeX\ is installed:

```console
$ softcover build:pdf
```

\noindent The result appears in Figure~\ref{fig:example_pdf}.

![The example book PDF.\label{fig:example_pdf}](images/figures/example_pdf.png)

The `softcover build:pdf` command dumps a lot of output to the \linebreak screen, and as with EPUB and MOBI you can use command-line options to make the PDF builder quiet (`-q`) or silent (`-s`), but I strongly recommend using the default verbose option unless you're *sure* the file will build without error. The issue is that `xelatex` will hang on \LaTeX\ syntax errors, and you need to be able to type `x` to exit. (**Remember this**: type `x` to exit when the PDF builder hangs.)

By default, the PDF builder runs twice to ensure all cross-references are updated, but if the cross-references haven't changed (or if your book doesn't have any) you can pass an option to make it run only once:

```console
$ softcover build:pdf --once
```

\noindent This not only saves valuable time when building a longer book, but it is also useful when you're debugging a \LaTeX\ syntax error and you don't want to keep pressing `x` twice every time you run the command.

As noted in Section~\ref{sec:html_softcover_server}, the latest version of `softcover server` also supports PDF output:

```console
$ softcover server --pdf
```

\noindent In this case, the server will rebuild the PDF using

```
softcover build:pdf --once
```

\noindent under the hood. This is especially useful when typesetting documents (such as math-heavy manuscripts) that include formatting not fully supported by HTML output but work fine in PDF\@. In such cases, it is strongly recommended to use a PDF viewer like [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) that can be configured to reload modified PDFs automatically. (To configure Skim to auto-reload PDFs, go to Skim > Preferences, click Sync, and then select "Check for file changes" and check "Reload automatically". Strangely, neither Adobe Acrobat Reader nor macOS Preview can do such auto-reloading as of this writing.)

#### All formats
\label{sec:build_all}

Once you've installed all the dependencies as above, you can build all formats at once:

```console
$ softcover build:all
```

\noindent On my system (an older MacBook Air), Softcover builds the template book (all formats) in under 15 seconds:

```console
$ time softcover build:all --silent

real    0m14.159s
user    0m12.086s
sys 0m1.185s
```

The behavior of `softcover build:all` is customizable via the \linebreak `.softcover-build` file. See Section~\ref{sec:customizing_builds} for details.


#### Previews
\label{sec:build_previews}

Finally, Softcover can optionally build a *preview* of your book in each output format, which is a particularly useful feature when selling your ebook (either on your own website or at [Softcover](https://www.softcover.io)). Because of the different ways the PDF and EPUB/MOBI formats work, there are two separate ways to specify the preview range. (You have to keep them roughly in sync by hand, but it's rarely important for the preview ranges to be exact, so this isn't a big problem in practice.) The configuration for PDF is a *page* range, while for EPUB/MOBI it's a *chapter* range (with "Chapter 0" being frontmatter like the table of contents, preface, etc.). Both ranges are specified in `book.yml` (Listing~\ref{code:preview_ranges}).

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:preview_ranges}
\codecaption{Specifying the preview ranges in \texttt{book.yml}. \\ \filepath{config/book.yml}}
```yaml
---
.
.
.
pdf_preview_page_range: 1..30
epub_mobi_preview_chapter_range: 0..1
```
\end{codelisting}

The previews themselves are built as follows:

```console
$ softcover build:preview
```

The full Softcover publishing platform automatically uploads all the ebook files, including the preview for each format, and makes it simple to distribute them to your readers. We'll learn how to do this in the next section (Section~\ref{sec:softcover_website}).

#### Debugging tip

Building ebooks generates many temp and auxiliary files that can sometimes get corrupted and ruin the build, so Softcover provides a utility to clean up the working directory by removing such files:

```console
$ softcover clean
```

\noindent If your ebook build build hangs when you think it should be working, try running `softcover clean` to see if that helps.


### Cover images
\label{sec:cover_images}

Softcover comes with default cover images, which you should change before distributing any of the formats or deploying the the Softcover website (Chapter~\ref{cha:marketing_selling}). The files appear as follows:

```text
$ ls images/cover*
images/cover-web.png   images/cover.jpg    images/cover.pdf    images/cover.png
```

\noindent If present, the file `cover.jpg` is used for EPUB and MOBI output; otherwise, `cover.png` is used. Meanwhile, `cover.pdf` is used for the PDF\@. (Eventually we plan to automatically generate a smaller cover image for display on the web, but for now you need to make a separate image called `cover-web.png` as well.)


## Publishing to the Softcover website
\label{sec:softcover_website}

The \softcover\ command-line client includes commands for interacting with the [Softcover.io](https://www.softcover.io) website, making it easy to publish the book (in all its formats) to the live web. In this section, we'll discuss the steps needed to see a book-in-progress during the writing process; Chapter~\ref{cha:marketing_selling} discusses the details needed when preparing to make your book publicly available.

### Publishing ebooks

To get started with [Softcover.io](https://www.softcover.io), first [create an account](https://www.softcover.io). Once you have an account, log in using the CLI as follows:

```console
$ softcover login
```

\noindent At this point, you're ready to publish to the live site:

```console
$ softcover build:all
$ softcover build:preview
$ softcover publish
```

\noindent You can now navigate to your book using your web browser, and in macOS and Linux you can open the book at the command line as well:

```console
$ softcover open
```

\noindent The result appears in Figure~\ref{fig:softcover_live_book}.

![The HTML book on the live website.\label{fig:softcover_live_book}](images/figures/softcover_live_book.png)

### One command to rule them all
\label{sec:deploy_command}

For convenience, Softcover comes with a `deploy` command to build everything and publish the result:

```console
$ softcover deploy
```

\noindent By default, this is equivalent to the following three steps:

```console
$ softcover build:all
$ softcover build:preview
$ softcover publish
```

\noindent The behavior of `softcover deploy` is customizable via the \linebreak `.softcover-deploy` file in the book's root directory. See Section~\ref{sec:customizing_deploys} for details.

Using `softcover deploy` makes publishing to the Softcover website completely frictionless: make a change, type `softcover deploy`, and your book (in all output formats) is updated automatically.

### Articles
\label{sec:articles}

Softcover also supports the LaTeX *article* format, which produces an ebook that is effectively a single chapter. As mentioned above, the tutorials at [Learn Enough\href{http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/robot-army-future---killer-5053344}{robot armies} to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/) use this format.

You can generate an article using the `-a` option to `softcover new`:

```console
$ softcover new -a example_article
```

\noindent The discussion above regarding HTML, the Softcover server, ebook formats, etc., applies to articles as well.


<!-- footnotes  -->

[^copy_directories]: Because Softcover books include a several elements that are specific to each book (including a symlink for the images directory, an internal book id, and a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) included to fulfill a requirement of the EPUB standard), book directories should never be copied by hand to create new books. Instead, all new books should be generated using `softcover new`, and then any necessary files should be copied over individually.

[^poly_pronunciation]: \PolyTeXnic\ is pronounced exactly like the English word [*polytechnic*](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/polytechnic). The core input-to-output conversion is still handled by the \texttt{polytexnic} gem.

[^maxwell]: Eq.~\eqref{eq:maxwell} is written in *rationalized [MKS units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKS_system_of_units)* (also known as ``God's units''), which set \( \mu_0=\epsilon_0=1 \). (In addition to being beautiful, this choice of units gives us \( c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0} = 1 \) for free.)

[^multiple_browsers]: Take care to attach only one browser at a time; otherwise, the Softcover server won't know which browser to refresh.

[^sc_s]: For brevity, you can use `s` in place of `server`, as in `softcover s`. Since `sc` is an alias for `softcover`, you can even write `sc s` to start the local server. This is a little cryptic, so in the text I write `softcover server`, but in real life I nearly always just type `sc s`.

[^ipad_address]: You can find the server's local network address by examining the results of `ifconfig`; in my experience the relevant address usually begins with 192 (when on the local wireless network) or 172 (when the iPad is attached directly to the computer), so you can probably extract the right local address using the command `ifconfig | egrep '(172|192)'`. Then add a colon and the port number (4000 by default). For example, on my system the correct address to connect the iPad to is typically 172.20.10.3:4000.

[^epub_path]: If `$HOME/bin` does not exist, you can create it using `mkdir $HOME/bin`. Then move EpubCheck there using `mv epubcheck-4.0.1 $HOME/bin`. Depending on your system, you might have to add `$HOME/bin` to the path by editing and sourcing `.bash_profile` (as shown in Listing~\ref{code:calibre_bash_profile} and Listing~\ref{code:source_bash_profile}).

[^sudo_install]: `sudo gem install <gem name>`
